# Whisper on IPUs
Whisper is a versatile speech recognition model that can transcribe speech as well as perform multi-lingual translation and recognition tasks. It was trained on diverse datasets to give human-level speech recognition performance without the need for fine-tuning.

ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and Graphcore IPUs. It provides a set of tools enabling model parallelization and loading on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by Transformers while being compatible with the Hugging Face Hub and every model available on it out of the box.

In this notebook, we demonstrate using Whisper for speech recognition and transcription on the IPU. We use the Optimum Graphcore package to interface between the IPU and the Hugging Face Transformers library. Only a few lines of code are needed to get this state-of-the-art automated speech recognition model running on IPUs.
