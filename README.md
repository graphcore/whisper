# Whisper on IPUs
Whisper is a versatile speech recognition model that can transcribe speech as well as perform multi-lingual translation and recognition tasks. It was trained on diverse datasets to give human-level speech recognition performance without the need for fine-tuning.

ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and Graphcore IPUs. It provides a set of tools enabling model parallelization and loading on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by Transformers while being compatible with the Hugging Face Hub and every model available on it out of the box.
